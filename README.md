# Grave Runner ☠️

How long can you outrun Fate? Find out in this chilling command-line adventure through object-oriented programming.

_A rediscovered piece of code, kept now for posterity._

From that time when the lightbulb clicked about how runners and objects work while walking past a graveyard in Manhattan.

## How to play

From the main directory, start the game with:
 `ruby graveyard_runner.rb`

 The rest is up to Fate.
